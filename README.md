Case Study
A client has come forward with a proposal to create an application that aids renters in
comparing their housing options. The primary goal is to develop an application that allows
potential renters to understand the trade-offs between flats they find relevant, thereby
simplifying their decision-making process.
The application features a single user type—the flat seeker. This user is responsible for
managing all flat data including insertions, updates, and deletions. The application will
enable users to navigate through flat listings in a user-friendly manner, allowing them to
mark and unmark their favorite flats.
